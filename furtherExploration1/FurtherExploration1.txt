We ran both a discontiguous megablast and blastn on the first and second transcript from the uniquetranscripts.fasta file.
Our original megablast contained 106 hits for Transcript 1 and 55 hits for Transcript 2.
The discontiguous megablast resulted in 105 hits for Transcript 1 and 150 hits for Transcript 2. 
The blastn search resulted in 106 hits for Transcript 1 and 158 hits for Transcript 2. 

We realized that the broadened searches generated essentially the same hits for Transcript 1 but much more hits for Transcript 2.
However, both broaded searches generated very similar results. 

When we restricted the database for only Human matches. The number of hits drastically decreased for both searches. However, blastn generated more hits than discontiguous megablast.
This makes sense because blastn is better suited for searching across phylogenies.
