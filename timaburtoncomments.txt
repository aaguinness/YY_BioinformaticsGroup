Comments for timaburton modeling project

There may be value in changing your graph colors (the grey is difficult to see) and add a plot legend. ggplot does have a legend argument. You can also specify colors using hex codes as "#FFFFFF", etc. (syntax may be slightly different in Python; this is true for R)

ggplot code looks neater with + on new line (with tabs) to make code more easily readable. 

Nice use of lists and tuples.

Code is very well commented and organized into well-sized, manageable file numbers. 

For file PredatorVPREY.pdf, it would be nice to add labels (and maths) designed to make sense of the diagrams you put together for the two model types in ppt. 

It may have been cleaner to have made a params df in lieu of many vectors. 

Use of Markdown really good!
