Qualitative comparison of trends in our data to that in Kuhns + Pluznick et al 2017 
(K+P)

Gene: Gsta2
Relative expression decreased from control mice to obese mice, which matches the 
trend observed in K+P.

Gene: Scl7a12
K+P reported a significant decrease of expression in obese mice. However, our data 
shows no qualitative difference between control and obese mice for this gene.

Gene: Ptpn5
K+P found significant increase in obese mice, but our results show no qualitative 
difference between control and obese mice for this gene.

Gene: Atp12a
Relative expression increased from control mice to obese mice, which matches the 
trend observed in K+P.

Gene: Lhx2
Relative expression increased in obese mice. K+P found a significant increase in 
expression in obese mice as well.

Gene: Synpr
Relative expression greatly increased in obese mice compared to control mice. This 
is the same trend seen in K+P.
